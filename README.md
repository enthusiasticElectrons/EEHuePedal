Hue Pedal by Tim Bartlett and Enthusiastic Electrons

This is a blinky that I made for kids who just want to push buttons and turn knobs on FX pedals. It has a single RGB smart pixel, whose hue is adjusted by a single knob. The footswitch is the power switch. It's programmed for an ATTiny85 at 8mHz, with 3x 1.5v batteries.
